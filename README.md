    Webhook API is an API that makes dealing with Discord Webhooks much easier than using raw requests. API covers 100% support for HTTP modules and supports worlds!
</p>

# ðŸ“¦ INSTALLATION
1. Navigate to [releases](https://github.com/m0lc14kk/WebhookAPI/releases) and download the latest one.

2. Install `index.js` (or `index.ts` if you're using TypeScript) and `index.d.ts` files and drag them into your project.

3. Start using our API in your code!

# ðŸ“Œ REQUIREMENTS
Before you will begin with installation this API, create a basic add-on template before. It should have atleast a manifest and a scripting folder.

- ### BDS:
    - Activate **Experimental Beta API** in a world.
    - Add `@minecraft/server-net` module to server's permissions (`config/default/permissions.json`):
      ```json
        {
            "allowed_modules": [
                // Other modules does not matter.
                "@minecraft/server-gametest",
                "@minecraft/server",
                "@minecraft/server-ui",
                "@minecraft/server-admin",
                "@minecraft/server-editor",
                "@minecraft/server-net" // Paste this module at the end of a file.
            ]
        }
        ```
    - Add `@minecraft/server-net` to pack's manifest:
        ```json
        {
            "dependencies": [
                // Other dependencies.
                {
                    "module_name": "@minecraft/server-net",
                    "version": "1.0.0-beta" // Version does not matter.
                }
            ]
        }

- ### Worlds:
    At this moment, worlds are not supported. Consider using redirects with `@minecraft/server-admin` to an external server.
