# Code of Conduct for the Discord Webhook API – by m0lc14kk

## Our Pledge

As contributors, developers, and community members of this Minecraft: Bedrock Vanilla API project, we pledge to make participation in this community a welcoming and respectful experience for everyone. That includes players, modders, developers, and curious tinkerers alike - regardless of background, identity, or level of experience.

We’re here to build cool things, learn from each other, and create a space where everyone feels safe, heard, and encouraged to contribute.

## Our Standards

Positive behaviors we encourage:

- Being friendly, helpful, and supportive to newcomers and veterans alike
- Respecting different opinions, coding styles, and design choices
- Offering constructive feedback, and being open to it in return
- Keeping conversations on-topic and inclusive
- Using language and humor that’s appropriate for all ages

Unacceptable behaviors include:

- Harassment, discrimination, or personal attacks of any kind
- Posting or linking to NSFW or offensive material
- Doxxing or sharing private information without consent
- Spamming, trolling, or intentionally disrupting discussions
- Dismissing others’ contributions without good reason

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all official project spaces: GitHub repos, Discord chats, documentation comment threads, and any public events or online communities connected to this API.

If you are representing the project - whether through your code, support, or communication - you’re expected to uphold this standard.

## Reporting Issues

If you see or experience something that violates this Code of Conduct, please reach out to me directly on **Discord: m0lc14kk**. Reports will be treated seriously and confidentially.

No retaliation will be tolerated against anyone who makes a report in good faith.

## Enforcement

When a violation occurs, community leaders will take appropriate action based on the severity and nature of the behavior. Here’s what that process may look like:

### 1. **Friendly Reminder**

For minor, one-time slip-ups.  
**Action:** A gentle DM reminding the person of our community standards.

### 2. **Formal Warning**

For repeated or more disruptive behavior.  
**Action:** A written warning, possibly with a temporary timeout from project spaces.

### 3. **Temporary Ban**

For serious or ongoing issues.  
**Action:** Temporary removal from Discord, GitHub, or other official spaces.

### 4. **Permanent Ban**

For harassment, hate speech, or sustained bad behavior.  
**Action:** Permanent removal from all official community channels.

Enforcement decisions will be made as fairly and transparently as possible. In most cases, we’ll explain the reasons behind moderation actions - except where it may put others at risk.

## A Final Note

We’re all here because we love Minecraft and want to make it even more fun through useful tools like this API. Let’s keep this space awesome for everyone.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant v2.0](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html) with customizations for this project.
